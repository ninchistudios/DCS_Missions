Super Carrier Static Deck Spawns Menu available! - Super Carrier Maps ONLY.

Big thanks to Redkite for allowing me to add these amazing static deck layouts for the Super Carrker.

You do not have to add these template scripts in yourself, you can simply adjust the layouts using the F10 Menu to add static layouts and remove them. You can mix and match as you please in REAL TIME during the mission.

AI Helo-Troop Transport Script by 107th Rz and 107th deadlyfishes

In the settings in the mission triggers labeled as:
"AI TROOP TRANSPORT SETTINGS"

Change in qoutes which mission where you want troops to be dropped off.
NOTE: The helo will START at the MAIN AIRBASE. A2G Easy/Hard can be quite far from the main airbase. We recommend choosing A2G Inf ASsault or A2G Helo Missions.


ai_troops_transport_location = "a2g easy"

choices:
"a2g helo"
"a2g infantry assault"
"a2g easy"
"a2g hard"
"none"

CTLD Extract/Pickup DOES WORK with these troops!

______________

"ZEUS" MAP MARKER SPAWNS AND COMMANDS:
You can CREATE and DESTROY units out of thin air in real-time while the game is running at ANY location you choose on the F10 map, like in "Zeus" mode from ArmA 3.

Call in an AI Helo-Troop Transport:
1) Place a map marker where you want droops to be dropped off.
2) Type in the map marker "drop troops here" without the qoutes.
3) CLOSE the map marker by hitting the X button on the map marker and watch a helo come in to drop off troops at that location!
4) command troops to do whatever you want. You can even extract/re-deploy them with CTLD.

Create units:
1) Add a map marker of where you want to create a unit. DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING OR HIT ENTER JUST YET.

2) Type in "-create [NAME OF UNIT YOU WANT TO SPAWN FROM THE LIST]" DO NOT HIT ENTER OR LEAVE THE MARKER ON THE MAP JUST YET.
Example "-create f14_red" will create an element of REDFOR AI F-14's
"jtac" and "abrams" are friendly units to use combined arms with. Use the JTAC to spawn it anywhere to get a friend to control it for some fun Co-Op action!
Also, try creating your own ground attack units using the armor or infantry group spawn for an easier bulk spawn

UNITS CAN BE STACKED! Spawn as many of any unit as you like to create your own ground missions!

SPAWNABLE UNITS LIST:
[List redacted since now all units from DCS are available to spawn on both BLUE and RED, check zeus spawnable units text file for full list!]

3) Once you type your command in, hit the X button on the map marker (top right of the box) to initiate the spawn.


Destroy Ground Units: (Only works for ground units):
1) Add a map marker on top of the ground units you want to destroy/delete. DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING OR HIT ENTER JUST YET.

2) Type in "-destroy" and hit the X button on the map marker (top right of the box) to rid the area of ground units or ships.

Good for: Removing missions you don't want to complete or deleting your spawned in JTAC or Friendly Combined Arms units you no longer want in your mission.
WARNING: There is no way to get back friendly ship units, you'll have to restart the mission.
