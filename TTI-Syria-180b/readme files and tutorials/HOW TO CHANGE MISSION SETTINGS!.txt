HOW TO CHANGE MISSION SETTINGS:


GO TO THE TRIGGER LIST IN THE MISSION EDITOR (3rd icon under MIS on the LEFT PANEL)

On the FIRST TRIGGER, look in ACTIONS > DO SCRIPT.

There you can edit the number values for adjusting the mission properties.

AFTER EDITING, SAVE MISSION!!!!!

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE NUMBER VALUES!!!

This is what each setting does:


a2g_easy_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want A2G Easy missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g  hard missions active)
a2g_hard_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want A2G Hard missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g hard missions active)
a2g_helo_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want A2G helo missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g helo missions active)
a2g_helo_inf_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want A2G helo infantry missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g helo infantry assault missions active)
antiship_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE  if you want anti-ship missions auto-spawning (will start automatically if there are no other a2g missions active)

convoy_missions_autostart = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want convoy missions to auto-start
convoy_map_markers = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want map markers to reveal the convoy's position in the F10 map, this will be updated when you request intel.


allow_air_mission_stacking = SET TRUE OR FALSE to allow manually spawned air missions to be stacked. When false, only one type of A2A mission can be alive at a time. This helps to prevent constant spamming
of enemy air units.

Set the AI difficulty/skill of all aircraft for each coalition;
red_ai_aircraft_skill = "Average", "Good", "High", "Excellent", or "Random"
blue_ai_aircraft_skill = "Average", "Good", "High", "Excellent", or "Random"

a2a_autospawn_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random enemy A2A spawns 
a2a_intercept_autospawn_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random enemy bomber spawns  
a2a_helo_autospawn_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want random enemy helo spawns  

a2a_respawn_time_min = 5
a2a_respawn_time_max = 20
a2a_intercept_respawn_time_min = 1680
a2a_intercept_respawn_time_max = 3420
a2a_helo_respawn_time_min = 1680
a2a_helo_respawn_time_max = 3420
(TIME IN SECONDS)
for a dynamic spawn time choose a minimum and maximum time between spawns or make them the same if you want a static time between spawns.


allow_air_mission_stacking = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want Forced A2A missions (from the F10 Menu) to be infinitely stacked. Set false for more open training missions with more players, so they can't break the mission by infinitely spawning enemy aircraft.

--define how many bombers  at each spawn

ground_bomber_amount = how many bombers at each spawn
ship_bomber_amount = how many bombers at each spawn


___________________

Intel report settings:

___________________

sam_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE DEPENDING ON IF YOU WANT THERE TO BE RANDOM SAM SITES SPAWNING ON THE MAP OUTSIDE OF MISSION ZONES 
sam_site_jtacs_enable = SET TRUE OR FALSE IF YOU WANT JTACS THAT LASE/SMOKE AT THE RANDOM SAM SITES
sam_respawn_time = TIME IN SECONDS BETWEEN RANDOM SAM SITE SPAWN

enable_jtac_drones = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want to spawn the auto-lasing/smoking JTACS at ground missions.
jtac_smokes_targets = SET TRUE OR FALSE IF YOU WANT JTACS TO SMOKE LASED TARGETS!
jtac_default_laser_code = changes default laser code of predator drone jtacs

enemy_ship_ai = SET TRUE OR FALSE if you want enemy AI ships to attack/defend or do nothing.

carrier_groups_hold_fire = SET TRUE OR FALSE friendly carrier groups hold fire against enemy air
the carrier group will not shoot at anti-ship missions since they will always be able to destroy them instantly.

AI Helo-Troop Transport Script by 107th Rz and 107th deadlyfishes

In the settings in the mission triggers labeled as:
"AI TROOP TRANSPORT SETTINGS"

Change in qoutes which mission where you want troops to be dropped off.
NOTE: The helo will START at the MAIN AIRBASE. A2G Easy/Hard can be quite far from the main airbase. We recommend choosing A2G Inf ASsault or A2G Helo Missions.


ai_troops_transport_location = "a2g easy"

choices:
"a2g helo"
"a2g infantry assault"
"a2g easy"
"a2g hard"
"none"


-- max distance of the randomized landing zone point for normal a2g troop insertions
lz_outer_radius = 3000
lz_inner_radius = 2500

-- max distance of the zeus created landing zone point 
zeus_lz_outer_radius = 9500
zeus_lz_innter_radius = 9000

CTLD Extract/Pickup DOES WORK with these troops!

HOW TO CHANGE UNIT SPAWNING POOLS:

How spawning pools work in TTI - You set an A2G Hard mission to have 10 SAM units, it will spawn 10 SAM units, and for each one, 
it will randomly choose a SAM unit to spawn from the spawning pool under the SAM category. This way, you can control which 
sam types you could potentially have in a mission. The same goes for other spawning pools, if you don't want certain tanks or armor 
you can remove them, or you could even add more types by unblocking them from the spawn pool by removing the -- before the unit name.

-- Simply add two dashes -- before the name of the unit you want to remove from the spawning pool.
-- You can alternatively REMOVE two dashes before a unit to add it to the spawning pool.

--EXAMPLE, to ensure the SA-10 doesn't spawn the line with "sam_s10" will look like this
 --"sam_s10"

-- DO NOT DO ANYTHING HERE EXCEPT ADD/REMOVE DASHES TO THE UNITS YOU WANT ADDED/REMOVED FROM THE SPAWNING POOL.

 TemplateTable_SAM = { 
--"example of disabled unit"
"sam_s3",
"sam_s2",
--"sam_s10",
--"sam_s11",
"sam_s6",
} 

In the example above, the sa_11 and the sa_10 will not be part of the spawning pool for SAM units.

TemplateTable_AA = { 
"aa_ural",
"aa_shilka",
"aa_tunguska",
"aa_strella",
"aa_osa",
"aa_manpads",
 }
