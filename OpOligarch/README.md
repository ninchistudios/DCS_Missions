# Operation Oligarch

## Player Notes

### How It Works

Operation Oligarch is a co-op incremental campaign, which works as follows:

* The Initial conditions are set, and he players are provided with SITREP/INTREP.
* An Air Tasking Order is raised - possibly planned by the pilots who will fly it.
* The players prepare for and fly the mission. Once only, no mulligans.
* Based on the results of the mission, the situation changes and a new mission is prepared.
* Repeat until... well realistically until the mission designers lose interest.

### SOP

* Do not change aircraft loadouts
* destroyed SCM assets take 5 missions to replenish - be careful with your jets and protect the ships.

## Situation - Geopolitical

It is 2021. With sovereign governments in disarray due to COVID-19, wealthy oligarchs have begun to establish private nations with their own private military forces in order to conduct their business free of regulation and taxation. Foremost among them are the Chinese magnate Jack Ma, and the American entrepreneur Elon Musk.

Musk has negotiated the purchase of the Marianas Islands from the US government and intends to setup SpaceX operations there. He has also gone shopping in the US and allied boneyards, and has acquired a small army's worth of 1980/90s-era aircraft, vehicles and ships including CVN-73 George Washington (renamed RTFM) and the LHA-1 Tarawa (renamed PEBKAC).

While the SpaceX Colonial Marine group was preparing in San Diego, and once the sale of the Marianas was finalised, Jack Ma took the opportunity to occupy them; claiming that they were historically Chinese territory and gambling that neither the US nor China would not interfere militarily in a civilian dispute over now civilian-owned land. The gamble appears to have worked - both the US and China have clearly indicated that while they will continue to supply arms on a commercial basis, the oligarchs are on their own as long as no other nations interfere.

The SpaceX Colonial Marines (SCM) are now faced with the prospect of retaking the Marianas from the Ma International Liberation Force (MILF) and defending them from any and all civilian and insurgent threats while orbital infrastructure is built on Rota and Saipan.

The players are pilots of the SCM 1st Corps (c/s SKANK) operating FA/18-C, F-14B, AV-8B, UH-1H and SA-342.  Delivery of AH-64D and OH-58D, among other types, is currently being negotiated.

## Situation - Strategic

The SCM have entered the Guam Coastal ADIZ and currently sit approx 65nm northeast of Saipan. While the MILF have dug in on Guam and Rota, Saipan and Tinian to the north are relatively lightly defended, and the MILF Air Force (MILFAF) is under-supplied, giving the SCM an opportunity to seize air superiority if it can be achieved quickly. MILFs are not known to possess a CV at this time, so if the 5 Marianas airfields can be degraded, MILFAF will be unable to launch air assets.

SCM intend to establish and defend a foothold on Saipan, consolidate Tinian, and from there push south to retake Rota and Guam.

Strategic Objectives:

* Defend SCM naval group (continuous)
* Establish air superiority in the Marianas (not achieved)
* Occupy and defend Saipan (not achieved)
* Occupy and defend Tinian (not achieved)
* Occupy and defend Rota (not achieved)
* Occupy and defend Guam (not achieved)

RTFM Assets:

* 8 x F/A-18C
* 4 x F-14B
* 2 x E2-D
* 2 x S-3B
* 2 x UH-1H

PEBKAC Assets:

* 4 x AV-8B
