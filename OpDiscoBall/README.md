* LZ reconnaissance
* Advance to contact
* Artillery coordination
* AFAC
* Hunter-Killer operations
* BAI
* Smoke marking

SITUATION

It is 2017. Emboldened by political events in the US, and with ever more overt support from Russia, the Supreme Leadership of Iran dramatically stepped up its calls for the destruction of Israel and its support of insurgency against Israeli interests.

Following a number of horrific bombings and rocket attacks in Israel and widespread international condemnation, the tensions growing between the Ayatollah and his hawkish Revolutionary Guard, and the moderate President representing the Iranian Army and the majority of the Iranian people, became very obvious. Fearing the seeds of revolution, the Ayatollah cracked down hard internally and the President was forced into exile. Curfews were imposed and Iran is under martial law - leading ordinary Iranians to communicate widespread support for armed removal of the Ayatollah and IRG before the total shutdown of internet access across Iran.

Seizing the political opportunity, Israel successfully organised an international coalition to mount a strategic campaign in the Gulf to restore the moderate Presidency and Constitution of Iran, and dismantle the Islamic Theocracy as well as the die-hard IRG. The campaign began on 1 May 2017, with the coalition navies sweeping the northern Persian Gulf and preparing for a full ground campaign.

Key objectives of the campaign are:

* To seize and control all airfields, ports and key logistics hubs in Iran
* TBC

The players are armed reconnaissance pilots of the recently recommissioned Australian 163 Squadron, deployed aboard the HMAS Adelaide LHD in support of the 7th Brigade. Due to ongoing operational issues with the Tiger ARH, 163 Sqn was raised with the OH58D Kiowa Warrior and SA342 Gazelle platforms. The squadron has been supplemented with a number of US, French and British Instructor Pilots to accelerate operational readiness.
