# OPERATION DISCO BALL

## NOTES FOR PLAYERS

Operation Disco Ball is a multiplayer coop campaign based on a fictional Australian deployment to assist in an escalation of the Syrian Civil War. It is suitable for up to 4 players in co-op, and primarily focuses on rotary wing armed reconnaissance to show off the Kiowa Warrior and Apache modules, with options for air support and joint operations from co-op Hornets and Tomcats.

The campaign puts you in the seat of a armed recon helicopter during a large scale coalition engagement in Syria and Lebanon. It is being built with the Gazelle, with the intent to add options for the Kiowa Warrior and Apache on release.

The intent is to expose the pilot to realistic armed recon operations, including:

* visual reconnaissance
* Bomb damage assessment
* LZ reconnaissance
* Advance to contact
* Route clearance
* Artillery coordination
* AFAC
* Hunter-Killer operations
* BAI
* battlefield security
* CSAR
* Escort
* TBC

## SITUATION - GEOPOLITICAL

It is October 2017. The Syrian Civil War is raging again after the failed peace talks in March, and a NATO coalition has deployed to the Syrian AO to tackle the rising threat of ISIL and drive regime change in Syria to prevent widespread human rights abuses. Unstated but obvious are secondary objectives related to oil security and support for Israel.

Of course the Syrian theatre is very complex, with a number of sides all having their own public and private agendas:

* BLUFOR: NATO and allies including Syrian resistance forces and Task Force Disco Ball, the Australian and NZ contingent recently arrived, are actively conducting operations against REDFOR in Syria and ISIL everywhere. PINKFOR are not considered openly hostile, but have supported REDFOR in the past and are not trusted by BLUFOR. Pilots should be especially careful to note ROE regarding PINKFOR elements as the situation is fluid.
* REDFOR: The Syrian forces and Iran, as well as miscellaneous irregular forces. REDFOR are engaged openly with BLUFOR and ISIL.
* ISIL: Islamic State Insurgents are engaged in asymmetric operations against BLUFOR and REDFOR. There are allegations that ISIL have been supported by PINKFOR in the past both militarily and with materiel, however ISIL have also conducted hostilities against PINKFOR when opportunities presented.
* PINKFOR: Forces and materiel from Russia, China, Iraq and Hezbollah are generally non-hostile to all forces except ISIL and the BLUFOR Syrian resistance, against whom they support REDFOR. However when their interests are threatened, or when they perceive their support of REDFOR against the Syrian resistance puts them in opposition to the wider BLUFOR, they will defend their interests; and they have conducted low-grade hostilities against all other factions (particularly Israel and USA) at times when it suited them.
* GULF ARAB STATES: The Gulf Arab States are officially uninvolved in the conflict, however they consider ISIL, Iran and Israel ongoing threats to security in the region.
* RELIEF FORCES: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) elements operating under United Nations Peacekeeping Forces protection are providing humanitarian relief throughout the AO. Any collateral damage to these forces will cause a serious international incident.
* TURKEY: Sharing a large border with Syria and being a NATO member, Turkey is generally considered a BLUFOR member and provides access to airspace and facilities, particularly for the European NATO elements of the coalition who operate over northern Syria. However Turkey has previously conducted operations against BLUFOR Syrian resistance forces and thus remains a threat to the integrity of the coalition.

Key objectives of the BLUFOR campaign are:

Strategic:
* To remove the Bashar al-Assad Syrian regime and support a smooth transfer to constitutional democracy;
* To destroy ISIL in the region;
* To limit humanitarian crisis and collateral damage especially to humanitarian support forces; and
* To avoid escalation of hostilities with major powers and Arab states.

Tactical:
* To establish naval superiority in the western Mediterranean (achieved);
* To establish air superiority in Syrian and Mediterranean airspace;
* To destroy Syria's long range ballistic missile capability including underground ballistic missile facilities;
* To destroy Syria's SAM and anti-shipping missile capabilities;
* To seize and control all airfields, ports, POL storage and pipelines, logistics hubs and major supply routes in Syria;
* To locate and destroy the warfighting capability of the Syrian forces and ISIL; and
* To maintain ROE so as to preserve coalition integrity and international support.

## SITUATION - FRIENDLY

The players are armed reconnaissance pilots of the recently raised Australian 163 Squadron, deployed aboard the new Queen Elizabeth Class carrier HMAS Coffs Harbour in support of the 7th Brigade. Due to ongoing operational issues with the Tiger ARH, 163 Sqn was raised with a mix of loaned OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, AH-64D Apache and SA342 Gazelle platforms. The squadron has been supplemented with a number of US, French and British Instructor Pilots to accelerate operational readiness.

Elements of the Australian 75 Sqn RAAF (F/A-18C) have been deployed on CVN-73 George Washington alongside VFA-103 Jolly Rogers (F-14B) to support Task Force Disco Ball from the CVN. This provides supporting co-op opportunities for players who prefer fixed wing.
