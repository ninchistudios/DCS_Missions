OPERATION DISCO BALL

This campaign puts you in the seat of a armed reconnaissance helicopter during a large scale coalition engagement in the Persian Gulf and Iran. It is being built with the Gazelle, with the intent to convert it for the Kiowa Warrior on release.

The intent is to expose the pilot to realistic armed reconnaissance operations, including:

* visual reconnaissance
* Bomb damage assessment
* LZ reconnaissance
* Advance to contact
* Artillery coordination
* AFAC
* Hunter-Killer operations
* BAI
* battlefield security
* CSAR
* TBC

SITUATION

It is 2017. Emboldened by political events in the US, and with ever more overt support from Russia, the Supreme Leadership of Iran dramatically stepped up its calls for the destruction of Israel and its support of insurgency against Israeli interests.

Following a number of horrific bombings and rocket attacks in Israel and widespread international condemnation, the tensions growing between the Ayatollah and his hawkish Revolutionary Guard, and the moderate President representing the Iranian Army and the majority of the Iranian people, became very obvious. Fearing the seeds of revolution, the Ayatollah cracked down hard internally and the President was forced into exile. Curfews were imposed and Iran is under martial law - leading ordinary Iranians to communicate widespread support for armed removal of the Ayatollah and IRG before the total shutdown of internet access across Iran.

The IRG naval forces then began harassing shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, engaging in multiple acts of piracy and mining sections of the shipping channel on the Iranian side.

Seizing the political opportunity, Israel successfully organised an international coalition to mount a strategic campaign in the Gulf to restore the moderate Presidency and Constitution of Iran, and dismantle the Islamic Theocracy as well as the die-hard IRG. The campaign began on 1 May 2017, with the coalition navies sweeping the northern Persian Gulf and preparing for a full ground campaign.

Key objectives of the campaign are:

Strategic:
* To remove the Islamic Theocracy/Stratocracy ruling Iran and facilitate conditions that prevent its return, including supporting the return of the Iranian President and constitutional democracy
* To destroy the combat capability, C3 and training structure of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, including their ability to strike or support insurgency inside or outside Iran

Tactical:
* To establish naval superiority in the Persian Gulf (achieved)
* To establish air superiority in Iranian airspace
* To destroy the IRG's long range ballistic missile capability including underground ballistic missile facilities
* To destroy the IRG's SAM and anti-shipping missile capabilities
* To seize and control all airfields, ports, POL storage and pipelines, logistics hubs and major supply routes in Iran
* To locate and destroy the warfighting capability of the IRG
* To maintain ROE so as to preserve positive relations with Iranian regular forces and civilians

The players are armed reconnaissance pilots of the recently raised Australian 163 Squadron, deployed aboard the HMAS Adelaide LHD in support of the 7th Brigade. Due to ongoing operational issues with the Tiger ARH, 163 Sqn was raised with the OH58D Kiowa Warrior and SA342 Gazelle platforms. The squadron has been supplemented with a number of US, French and British Instructor Pilots to accelerate operational readiness.
